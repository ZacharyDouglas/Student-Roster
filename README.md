# Student-Roster
Utilizing Vectors and Lists to Read and maintain student rosters
The idea behind this project is to utlize a vector containing a list of students for each course.
I've implemented the ability to Read, Print, and Compare the rosters.  During the comparison, it will remove any duplicates.
